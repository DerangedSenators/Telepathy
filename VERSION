V1.1 [2021-02-01]
- stability: added more tests
- breaking: Server/Client.Send: ArraySegment parameter and copy internally so
  that Transports don't need to worry about it
- perf: Buffer.BlockCopy instead of Array.Copy
- perf: SendMessageBlocking puts message header directly into payload now
- perf: receiveQueues use SafeQueue instead of ConcurrentQueue to avoid
  allocations
- Common: removed static state
- perf: SafeQueue.TryDequeueAll: avoid queue.ToArray() allocations. copy into a
  list instead.
- Logger.Log/LogWarning/LogError renamed to Log.Info/Warning/Error
- MaxMessageSize is now specified in constructor to prepare for pooling
- flaky tests are ignored for now
- smaller improvements
